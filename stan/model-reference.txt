model-1.stan

This is a simple model that has batter parameters and pitcher parameters
with a single type of outcome. It also has batter parameters for
pitcher characteristics and context variables (location, outs, etc.).



model-2.stan

This is the first attempt at a multinomial outcome. The first draft
will have only batter and pitcher parameters and the outcome
will be multinomial.
